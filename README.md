## 🚀 Deployment

 - The application is deployed on Vercel.
  
 - Steps followed:
  
 - Pushed project to GitHub
  
 - Imported repository into Vercel
  
 - Added Supabase environment variables
  
 - Configured Supabase Auth redirect URLs
  
 - Verified Google OAuth flow in production

## 🧠 Challenges & Solutions

### 1️⃣ Realtime UI Not Updating Immediately
  
  Issue: Bookmarks were only visible after manual refresh.
  
  Solution: Implemented Supabase Realtime subscription using .channel() and triggered UI refresh on postgres_changes.
  
### 2️⃣ OAuth Redirect Issues After Deployment
  
  Issue: Login worked locally but failed in production.
  
  Solution: Added Vercel production URL to Supabase Auth redirect settings.
  
### 3️⃣ GitHub Permission Conflicts During Deployment

  Issue: Push permission errors due to multiple GitHub accounts.
  
  Solution: Updated remote repository and re-authenticated using correct GitHub account.

### 4️⃣ Tailwind CSS styles not applying initially

Issue: UI styles were not visible after adding Tailwind classes.

Solution: Configured Tailwind content paths correctly and ensured global CSS was imported in the root layout.
